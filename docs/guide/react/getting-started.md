# Getting started

This guide will help you get started with Lucide in your React project.
Make sure you have a React environment set up. If you don't have one yet, you can create a new React project using Create React App, Vite, or any other React boilerplate of your choice.

## Installation

::: code-group

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm install lucide-react
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add lucide-react
```

```sh [npm]
npm install lucide-react
```

```sh [bun]
bun add lucide-react
```

## Importing your first icon

Lucide is built with ES Modules, so it's completely tree-shakable.

Each icon can be imported as a React component, which renders an inline SVG element. This way, only the icons that are imported into your project are included in the final bundle. The rest of the icons are tree-shaken away.

### Example

Additional props can be passed to adjust the icon:

```jsx
import { Camera } from 'lucide-react';

// Usage
const App = () => {
  return <Camera color="red" size={48} />;
};

export default App;
```

## Props

| name                  | type      | default      |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| `size`                | *number*  | 24           |
| `color`               | *string*  | currentColor |
| `strokeWidth`         | *number*  | 2            |
| `absoluteStrokeWidth` | *boolean* | false        |

### Applying props

To customize the appearance of an icon, you can pass custom properties as props directly to the component. The component accepts all SVG attributes as props, which allows flexible styling of the SVG elements. See the list of SVG Presentation Attributes on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/Presentation).

```jsx
// Usage
const App = () => {
  return <Camera size={48} fill="red" />;
};
```

<OverviewLinkGrid>
  <OverviewLink v-for="item in reactSidebar[1].items" :key="item.link" :href="item.link" :title="item.text" :desc="item.desc"/>
</OverviewLinkGrid >
