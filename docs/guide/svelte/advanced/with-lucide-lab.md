# With Lucide lab or custom icons

[Lucide lab](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide-lab) is a collection of icons that are not part of the Lucide main library.

They can be used by using the `Icon` component.
All props like regular lucide icons can be passed to adjust the icon appearance.

## Using the `Icon` component

This creates a single icon based on the iconNode passed and renders a Lucide icon component.

```svelte
<script>
import { Icon } from '@lucide/svelte';
import { pear, sausage } from '@lucide/lab';
</script>

<Icon iconNode={pear} />
<Icon iconNode={sausage} color="red"/>
```
